1. what is database?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

2. Characterstics of DBMS?

A database management system is able to store any kind of data in a database.

The database management system has to support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties.

The Database management system allows so many users to access databases at the same time.

Backup and recovery are the two main methods which allow users to protect the data from damage or loss.

It also provides multiple views for different users in a single organization.

It follows the concept of normalization which is helpful to minimize the redundancy of a relation.

It also provides users query language, helpful to insert, retrieve, update, and delete the data in a database.

3. DBMS vs RDBMS

An RDBMS represents data in the form of tables, with rows and columns, and allows users to create relationships between these tables using keys. In contrast, a DBMS may use a variety of data models, such as the hierarchical model or the network model, to represent data.

4. what is database schema?

A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is overall of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.

5. ACID property in DBMS?

A: Atomicity ---> Atomicity ensures that the transaction is completed in 								its entirety or not at all because transactions don't happen partially.

C: Consistency ---> Consistency makes sure that the data is valid before 									and after the transaction.

I: Isolation----> Isolation ensures that multiple transactions can occur 								simultaneously without interfering with each other.

D: Durablity---> durability ensures that once a transaction is 											committed, it is permanent. Even if the system fails, 									the changes in transactions are stored permanently.
